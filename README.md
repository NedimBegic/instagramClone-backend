<h1>Instagram Clone Project Documentation</h1>

  <p>Welcome to the documentation for my Instagram Clone project! This project is aimed at replicating some of the key
        features of the popular social media platform Instagram. It's built using Next.js for the frontend, Node.js for
        the backend, and MongoDB as the database. Throughout the development of this project, I've gained a deeper
        understanding of various technologies and concepts including <code>useContext</code>, re-rendering components upon
        database changes, token-based authentication, working with cookies, and utilizing <code>getStaticProps</code> and
        <code>getStaticPaths</code> for dynamic user and post pages.</p>
